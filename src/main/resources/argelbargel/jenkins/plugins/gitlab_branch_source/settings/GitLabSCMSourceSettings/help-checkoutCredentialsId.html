        Credentials used to check out sources during a build.

    <p>
        Usually you should create an <strong>SSH username with private key</strong> credential and
        specify an SSH private key that belongs to the same user used by the selected gitlab-connection.
        This causes Jenkins to check out source code over SSH, and therefore
        you can run <code>git push</code> from your pipeline to push changes back.
